# Cogent: A clear, logical, and convincing, just like a good language

### Project Description

Cogent is an experimental programming language and runtime environment designed to explore the fundamental mechanics of language implementation. At its core, Cogent aims to build a minimalist yet powerful object system with a custom garbage collector.

<!-- ### Key Design Principles

- **Atomic Design**: Inspired by quantum mechanics, where each object is a fundamental "particle" of computation
- **Memory Efficiency**: Custom garbage collection that mimics natural system optimization
- **Simplicity**: Focusing on core language mechanics rather than extensive feature sets -->

### Technical Foundations

- Written entirely in C
- Custom object system with lightweight runtime
- Reference-based garbage collection
<!-- - Minimal runtime overhead -->
<!-- - Potential for embedded systems and educational use -->
